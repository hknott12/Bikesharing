# Bikesharing
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use data from NYC's CitiBike ridesharing program to provide information to help with the opening of a bike sharing company in Des Moines. Data were taken from Citibike's public data files and uploaded to create visualizations in Tableau. Links to the Tableau story and screenshots of the results are included below.

## Results
The first visualization created a line graph of the trip duration for all Citi Bike users in New York City. The results show that the majority of trips are less than one hour in length, with the majority trips being between 0 and 40 minutes.

The second and third visualizations broke down the trip duration by gender, with a line on the graph representing female, male, and unknown participants. The graph showed that male bike riders had the longest duration trips. The pie chart provides context as to the distrubiton of male and female users, with the majority of users being male.

The fourth visualization used a heatmap to show the most common start times by hour and day of the week for trips to occur, with ligther colors representing fewer trips and darker colors representing more trips. The results showed that the most common times for trips are weekday mornings around 8-9 am, weekday evenings between 5-6 pm, and weekends. The fifth visualization showed a similar trend, but broken down by gender.

The sixth and seventh visualizations showed the difference in start times for subscribers and non-subscribers. A pie chart is included to show the distribution of subscribers and non-subscribers. The visualization for start times used the same heat map as the previous visualizations, and showed that the most common start times were among subscribers on weekdays. This suggests that the citi bike ride share program is being used by people commuting to their jobs on weekdays.

## Summary
The results of our analysis tell us a few important things: that most users are subscribers, male, and use bikes on weekdays. Further analysis can be done to determine more information about the ridesharing program. One additional visualization that may be helpful would be a breakdown of age of the citi bike riders. A heatmap similar to the start hours could be used to represent the most common ages represented. Another visualization that could be useful is a breakdown of the most popular starting stations to determine which stations are getting the most use.
